# Portable Raspberry Pi SDR

Created as part of my Independent Study: Raspberry Pi Architect course.

## 📡 What It Does
This project is a **portable software-defined radio (SDR)** setup using a Raspberry Pi and RTL-SDR dongle. It lets you **modulate and demodulate signals (like FM/AM)** and listen through a connected speaker using **SDR++**.

## 🧠 Why I Built It
I wanted a fully portable SDR setup that I could use to find and listen to radio signals anywhere. It’s also a mini Linux box you can bring with you—just place it on a table or lap, and you're good to go.

- **SDR Dongle**: RTL-SDR Blog V3 (Amazon)
- **Battery**: Energizer 20,000mAh 18w (Best Buy)
- **Display**: 7" Raspberry Pi official touchscreen (Amazon)
- **Pi Model**: Raspberry Pi 4GB Model B (2018) (Amazon)
